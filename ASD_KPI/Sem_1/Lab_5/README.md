Given a natural number n. Find the sum of the first n terms of a series of numbers,
given by a recurrent formula. There are three ways to solve the problem
(write three programs): 1) use a recursive procedure in the program or
a function that performs the calculation of both members of the series, and the amount on the recursive descent;
2) in the program to use a recursive procedure or function that performs
calculation of both members of the series, and the amount of recursive return; 3) in the program
use a recursive procedure or function that performs calculations
members of the series on the recursive descent, and the calculation of the amount on the recursive
return.
